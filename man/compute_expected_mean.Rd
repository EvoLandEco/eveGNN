\title{Compute Expected Means of Distributions}
\usage{
compute_expected_mean(dist_info)
}
\arguments{
\item{dist_info}{A list of lists where each inner list contains information about the
distribution for which to compute the expected mean. Each inner list must contain a
\code{distribution} field specifying the distribution type (one of "uniform", "normal",
"binomial", "poisson", "exponential"), and additional fields as required by the
distribution type. For example:
\itemize{
\item For Uniform: \code{min} (minimum value), \code{max} (maximum value)
\item For Normal: \code{mean} (mean value)
\item For Binomial: \code{size} (number of trials), \code{prob} (probability of success)
\item For Poisson: \code{lambda} (rate parameter)
\item For Exponential: \code{rate} (rate parameter)
}}
}
\value{
A numeric vector containing the expected mean of each distribution in \code{dist_info}.
}
\description{
This function computes the expected mean for a list of distributions based on the
distribution information provided. Supported distributions are Uniform, Normal,
Binomial, Poisson, and Exponential.
